This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).
Frontend Mentor challenges is helping me to improve my coding skills by building realistic projects. 
## Overview
This project is really an interesting one,it layout and colors are beautiful
and realistic. Beginning from the Html code, it was interesting as
i made use of div tag, img tag, h3 tag and p tag now moving to 
Css it was really interesting, making it responsive took me lot of time 
and am happy it appeared as the challenge demanded.

## My process
I made use of tags
'div' (as a container for the card)
'img' (as a container for the image)
'h3' (as a means to identify an important text)
'p' (used for creating a paragraph ).
used some css selectors and property.

## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learned how to make my code responsive though still learning, also 
using of margins, widths and paddings got more understanding on them,
lastly i learnt how to resolve errors when linking a font to a code.
```html
<h2>I will keep Learning</h2>
```css
.give-going{
color: brown;
}
## Continued development
- Responsiveness
- Margin/Padding
- Width
